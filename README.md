# IceCreamDB

Database Project by Scotty Orrock and Viyat Patel
Spring 2018


FRONT END DOCUMENTATION:

Used LAMP stack on Ubuntu 16.04 to run web server.
Load in MySQL scrips first, then manually launch account creator to create an account with a hashed password

then run the project and it will take you to login, from there you can make employee edits to the database.
